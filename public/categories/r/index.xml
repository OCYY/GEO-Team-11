      <description>IS415 Geospatial Analytics Project Proposal Title Assessing and improving age-friendliness in Singapore through GIS
Problem and motivation Aging population has always been a prominent issue in Singapore. The percentage of individuals over age 65 between 2010 and 2020 increased from 9% to 15.2% (link).

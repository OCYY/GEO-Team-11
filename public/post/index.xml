      <description>IS415 Geospatial Analytics Project ProposalTitleAssessing and improving age-friendliness in Singapore through GIS
Problem and motivationAging population has always been a prominent issue in Singapore. The percentage of individuals over age 65 between 2010 and 2020 increased from 9% to 15.2% (link). While there are many efforts by the government to solve this problem, it is inevitable that people will age and all of us will grow old one day.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

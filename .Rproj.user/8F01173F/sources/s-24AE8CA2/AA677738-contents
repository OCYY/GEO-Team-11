## IS415 Geospatial Analytics Project Proposal

### Title 
Spatial Analysis of the Distribution Pattern of Healthcare Facilities and Amenities in Singapore Using Geographic Information System

### Problem and Motivation
Aging population has always been a prominent issue in Singapore. The percentage of individuals over age 65 between 2010 and 2020 increased from 9% to 15.2%. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. While there are many efforts by the government to solve this problem, it is inevitable that people will age and all of us will grow old one day. 

**However, in this small city-state, would its current urban landscape be enough to support its elderly?**

It is essential that relevant facilities and amenities are strategically built and readily available for elderly in this land-scarce Singapore.

### Objectives
Through this project, we aim to build a Shiny application to:

- Analyse the supply and demand of age-friendly amenities and facilities in subzone planning area

- Analyse the availability of age-friendly amenities and facilities in subzone planning area

- Determine which areas needs more age-friendly amenities and facilities

### Reviews of Past Projects

  + Kernel Density Estimation Animation
  + Intensity Map based on KDE
  
* Learning Points
  + Animation when plotting the map and GIFs makes the entire analysis more lively and interesting. 
  
3. Ezmodel

* Aim of Study
  + Analyse how housing prices are affected by spatial variation among the features in local surroundings.

* Methodology
  + Geographically Weighted Regression
  + Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression
  + Isoline Mapping via Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation

* Learning Points
  + Users can download GWR output, saving the results that they need/ want.
  + Allow user to specify global and local variables for GWR. 


### Methodology 
Web scraping using R

- To gather data from websites where data is not readily available

Kernel Density Estimation 

- To calculate the density of aged population
- To calculate the density of age friendly amenities and facilities

Local Moranâ€™s I 

- Identifying outliers or clusters of amenities and facilities

Getis-Ord Gi*

- Identifying hot and cold spots of elderly/ amenities and facilities

Geographically weighted correlation

## IS415 Geospatial Analytics Project Proposal

### Title 
Assessing and improving age-friendliness in Singapore through GIS

### Problem and motivation
Aging population has always been a prominent issue in Singapore. The percentage of individuals over age 65 between 2010 and 2020 increased from 9% to 15.2% (link).  While there are many efforts by the government to solve this problem, it is inevitable that people will age and all of us will grow old one day. 

**However, in this small city-state, would its current urban landscape be enough to support its elderly?**

It is essential that relevant facilities and amenities are strategically built and readily available for elderly in this land-scarce Singapore.

### Project objectives
Through this project, we aim to build a Shiny application to:
- Analyse the supply and demand of age-friendly amenities and facilities in subzone planning area
- Analyse the availability of age-friendly amenities and facilities in subzone planning area
- Determine which areas needs more age-friendly amenities and facilities

### Literature reviews 

### Approach/ methodology 
Web scraping using R
- To gather data from websites where data is not readily available

Kernel Density Estimation 
- To calculate the density of aged population
- To calculate the density of age friendly amenities and facilities

Local Moranâ€™s I 
- Identifying outliers or clusters of amenities and facilities

Getis-Ord Gi*
- Identifying hot and cold spots of elderly/ amenities and facilities

Geographically weighted correlation
